# About Me

I'm currently a Senior Consultant at VMware by Broadcom, specializing in cloud architecture and VMware technologies.

## Background

As a Cloud Solution Architect, I've had the privilege of shaping and optimizing cloud solutions at DigiCo and Over The Wire. My work focuses on translating complex business requirements into practical, scalable cloud infrastructures.

## What I Do

**Solution Design & Documentation**  
I develop comprehensive architectural designs, from high-level strategies to detailed implementation plans. My architecture diagrams and design decision documents serve as the foundation for successful cloud initiatives.

**VMware Technology Expertise**  
Deep experience with VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), NSX-T, vSphere, and the broader VMware ecosystem. I specialize in multi-tenant environments, network virtualization, and automation.

**Resilience & Disaster Recovery**  
Building robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans is central to my approach. I focus on ensuring services remain resilient and available, even during disruptions.

**Collaborative Architecture**  
I actively participate in Architecture Review Boards and work closely with cross-functional teams to align technical solutions with organizational goals and industry best practices.

## This Blog

I created this blog to share technical insights, document solutions to complex problems, and contribute to the VMware community. Expect deep-dives into VCF networking, automation challenges, and practical implementation guides.
